          <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure, none of you, my dear readers would use a PESEL number
as a password or an encryption key.
Still, as unbelievable as it may sounds, recently 
I was talking with my friend on a topic of computer security and
he told me a horror story about a certain company doing exactly that.
Such practice is highly insecure and in this post I going to
prove that. Namely we will create an encrypted 7zip archive with
a random PESEL as a password and then we will crack it using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper&quot;&gt;John the Ripper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
