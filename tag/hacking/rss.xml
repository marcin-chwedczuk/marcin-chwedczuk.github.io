          <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, while cleaning my flat, I found an old Huawei E3131
USB modem. I planed to throw it away, but then I reminded myself
that this simple device, as virtually all modems, supports a
primitive text based interface known as “AT commands”.
And so I started thinking about
spending a few hours of my time
sending AT commands and figuring out what is actually
possible.
This post is the result of this few hours of hacking. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
