          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I switched from Visual Studio to using Vim I often experienced
Vim freezes. This was really annoying. At the beginning I was thinking
that maybe I installed too many plugins 
(using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim&quot;&gt;Vundle&lt;/a&gt;) or that
Vim is not as good as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
